# Exercise 4: GraphPlan Algorithm and Tower of Hanoi ðŸ§©

## Overview ðŸ“–
In this exercise, I implemented parts of the GraphPlan algorithm, designed heuristics derived from the planning graph, and created domain and problem files for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. ðŸ—¼

## Files ðŸ“‚
- **GraphPlan.py**: Implementation of the GraphPlan algorithm.
- **heuristics.py**: Functions for heuristics based on the planning graph.
- **tower_of_hanoi_domain.pddl**: Domain file for the Tower of Hanoi problem.
- **tower_of_hanoi_problem.pddl**: Problem file for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

Requirements âœ…
Python 3.x

How to Run:
1. Ensure all files are in the same directory.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the files.
4. Execute the command:
   python GraphPlan.py tower_of_hanoi_domain.pddl tower_of_hanoi_problem.pddl
