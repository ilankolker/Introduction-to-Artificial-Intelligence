## Exercise 3: 2048 ðŸŽ®

### Overview
In this exercise, I designed agents for the 2048 game using minimax and expectimax search algorithms, along with an evaluation function to guide decision-making.

### Key Files ðŸ“‚
- **multi_agents.py**: Contains implementations of multi-agent search algorithms.
- **2048.py**: The main file to run the 2048 game.
- **game_state.py**: Defines the GameState type for the 2048 game.
- **game.py**: Contains the game logic and supporting data types.
- **util.py**: Includes useful data structures for search algorithms.

### Running the Game ðŸš€
To start playing the game, use the following command:
```bash
python3 2048.py
