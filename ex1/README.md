# Project 1: Blokus AI Search Algorithms 🎮🤖

## Overview
In this project, I developed search algorithms for a simple game based on Blokus, focusing on optimizing player strategy and improving decision-making processes. The goal was to implement effective algorithms that could analyze game states and suggest optimal moves. 🧠✨

## Project Objectives
- Implement various search algorithms to explore game states. 🔍
- Evaluate the performance and efficiency of each algorithm. 📊
- Analyze the impact of different strategies on gameplay outcomes. 📈

## Algorithms Implemented
I implemented the following search algorithms:
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 🌲
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. 🌊
3. **A* Search**: Utilizes heuristics to prioritize paths that seem to lead most directly to the goal. ⭐️

## Game Rules
The game is based on the classic Blokus rules, where players take turns placing their pieces on a board. The objective is to place as many pieces as possible while blocking opponents. 🛡️🎲
